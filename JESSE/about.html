            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Jesse, a Computer Scientist based in Nairobi, Kenya. I have 2 years of experience in IT, Systems design and programming specializing majorly in Embedded Systems.</p>
            
            <p>I'm passionate about learning new technologies and understanding what makes them tick. My approach combines intricately taking apart systems and breaking down their moving parts to truly understand their relationships and to see their interconnections, modularizing them and piecing them back together almost like LEGO blocks .</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not working, you can find me listening to music or most likely watching something thought-provoking.</p>
            
            <h3>Non-Technical skils</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>My acting could quite literally carry you off. Fictional characters are just a thought away and I can most definitely bring them  to life like magic.</li>
                <li>I can impress you with a nice hand-drawn logo design or maybe even a poster that will carry your message clearly and leave a lasting impression in your targets' minds with my artistic touch and flare. Or maybe even a nice little piece of artwork both digital and traditional art.</li>
                <li>Trust me, your tummy and taste buds are going to be very grateful if you got a chance to have a meal whipped up by yours-truly. From pastries to cakes, cookies, sauces, meats...name them. If I don't already know how to make them well, then it's just a tutorial away, ane even on first try, it will be a culinary journey.</li>
